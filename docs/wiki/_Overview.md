Lodestone is a library containing all the code that I throughout my time in the modding scene have found useful. 
It contains utilities such as a rendering system, static config initialization, simplified block entities & inventories, a simple multiblock system, a custom fire effects, and so on. 
Just a bunch of random useful stuff that I needed in my other projects.

The way I approach writing this wiki will essentially work on a priority system. You are free to ping me at any time in my discord asking for help with a certain thing, and if I have time I will write about that thing here. After enough time the wiki will contain everything, with the most frequently used things being prioritized.
